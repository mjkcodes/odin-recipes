# odin-recipes

Welcome to the Recipes project!

The goal of this project is to create a basic HTML web page displaying various recipes.

For this project, I will have to demonstrate my ability to use the command line interface, Git and GitHub, and HTML. I will also have to demonstrate an understanding of how to commit and write proper commit messages.
